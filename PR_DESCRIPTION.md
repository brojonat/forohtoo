# Payment Gateway for Wallet Registration

## Summary

Implements a complete payment gateway system that requires payment before wallet registration. The system uses Solana Pay URLs with QR codes and Temporal workflows to orchestrate the payment-then-registration flow.

## Motivation

This feature enables monetization of the wallet monitoring service by requiring a one-time registration payment. Users receive a Solana Pay URL and QR code that they can scan with any Solana wallet app, and the system automatically detects the payment and completes registration.

## Core Features

### 1. Payment Gateway Configuration
- Environment variable-based configuration with validation
- Support for both SOL and SPL token payments
- Configurable fee amounts, timeouts, and memo prefixes
- Service wallet auto-registration on startup
- Disabled by default for backward compatibility

### 2. Invoice Generation
- Unique invoice IDs with UUID generation
- Solana Pay URL generation (solana:recipient?amount=..&memo=..)
- Base64-encoded PNG QR codes for easy scanning
- Expiration timestamps and status URLs
- Support for both native SOL and SPL tokens

### 3. Payment-Gated Registration Workflow
- Long-running Temporal workflow orchestrates the flow
- AwaitPayment activity monitors blockchain for matching transactions
- RegisterWallet activity completes registration after payment confirmed
- Heartbeat support for long-running operations
- Rollback patterns for data consistency
- Edge case handling (timeouts, missing payment, duplicate payments)

### 4. HTTP API Updates
- **POST /api/v1/wallet-assets**: Returns 402 Payment Required with invoice when payment gateway enabled
- **GET /api/v1/registration-status/{workflow_id}**: Query workflow status and registration progress
- Invoice includes payment URL, QR code, amount, expiry, and status URL

## Implementation Details

### Configuration (service/config/config.go)
```go
type PaymentGatewayConfig struct {
    Enabled         bool
    ServiceWallet   string
    ServiceNetwork  string
    FeeAmount       int64
    FeeAssetType    string
    FeeTokenMint    string
    PaymentTimeout  time.Duration
    MemoPrefix      string
}
```

Environment variables:
- `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_ENABLED` - Enable/disable the payment gateway
- `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_SERVICE_WALLET` - Wallet address to receive payments
- `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_SERVICE_NETWORK` - mainnet or devnet
- `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_FEE_AMOUNT` - Amount in lamports (1 SOL = 1B lamports)
- `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_FEE_ASSET_TYPE` - "sol" or "spl-token"
- `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_FEE_TOKEN_MINT` - SPL token mint address (if using SPL tokens)
- `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_PAYMENT_TIMEOUT` - Duration string (e.g., "24h")
- `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_MEMO_PREFIX` - Prefix for payment memos (e.g., "forohtoo-reg:")

### Invoice Generation (service/server/invoice.go)
- `generatePaymentInvoice()` - Creates invoice with all required fields
- `buildSolanaPayURL()` - Generates Solana Pay compatible URL
- `generateQRCode()` - Creates base64-encoded PNG QR code

### Temporal Workflow (service/temporal/workflow_payment.go)
```go
PaymentGatedRegistrationWorkflow:
  1. AwaitPayment - Wait for matching transaction on blockchain
  2. RegisterWallet - Complete registration after payment confirmed
```

### Activities (service/temporal/activities_payment.go)
- **AwaitPayment**: Uses client.Await() to monitor blockchain, sends heartbeats every 25s
- **RegisterWallet**: Upserts wallet and schedule, with rollback on failure

### Handler Updates (service/server/handlers.go)
- `handleRegisterWalletAsset()` - Checks payment gateway, returns 402 with invoice
- `handleGetRegistrationStatus()` - Returns workflow execution status

## Breaking Changes

### 1. Transaction.Memo Type Change
**Before:**
```go
type Transaction struct {
    Memo string
}
```

**After:**
```go
type Transaction struct {
    Memo *string  // Now a pointer to properly represent optional field
}
```

**Impact:** Code that accesses `txn.Memo` must now check for nil and dereference
**Files affected:**
- `client/wallet.go`
- `service/temporal/activities.go`
- `cmd/forohtoo/wallet_commands.go`

### 2. Server Constructor Signature
**Before:**
```go
func New(addr string, cfg *config.Config, store *db.Store,
         scheduler temporal.Scheduler, ssePublisher *SSEPublisher,
         metrics *metrics.Metrics, logger *slog.Logger) *Server
```

**After:**
```go
func New(addr string, cfg *config.Config, store *db.Store,
         scheduler temporal.Scheduler, temporalClient *temporal.Client,
         ssePublisher *SSEPublisher, metrics *metrics.Metrics,
         logger *slog.Logger) *Server
```

**Impact:** All Server.New() calls need to pass temporalClient parameter
**Files affected:**
- `cmd/server/main.go`
- `service/server/integration_test.go`

### 3. Activities Constructor Update
**Before:**
```go
func NewActivities(store StoreInterface, mainnetClient, devnetClient SolanaClientInterface,
                   publisher PublisherInterface, metrics *metrics.Metrics,
                   logger *slog.Logger) *Activities
```

**After:**
```go
func NewActivities(store StoreInterface, mainnetClient, devnetClient SolanaClientInterface,
                   publisher PublisherInterface, paymentClient PaymentClientInterface,
                   scheduler SchedulerInterface, metrics *metrics.Metrics,
                   logger *slog.Logger) *Activities
```

**Impact:** Worker setup must pass payment client and scheduler
**Files affected:**
- `service/temporal/worker.go`

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Deployments

1. **Update environment variables** - Add payment gateway configuration to your `.env` or environment:
   ```bash
   PAYMENT_GATEWAY_ENABLED=false  # Keep disabled initially
   PAYMENT_GATEWAY_SERVICE_WALLET=YourWalletAddress
   PAYMENT_GATEWAY_SERVICE_NETWORK=mainnet
   PAYMENT_GATEWAY_FEE_AMOUNT=1000000  # 0.001 SOL
   PAYMENT_GATEWAY_FEE_ASSET_TYPE=sol
   PAYMENT_GATEWAY_PAYMENT_TIMEOUT=24h
   PAYMENT_GATEWAY_MEMO_PREFIX=forohtoo-reg:
   ```

2. **Create a service wallet**:
   ```bash
   # Using Solana CLI
   solana-keygen new --outfile ~/.config/solana/forohtoo-service.json

   # Get the public address
   solana address -k ~/.config/solana/forohtoo-service.json
   ```

3. **Update application code**:
   - Update Server.New() calls to include temporalClient parameter
   - Update Worker initialization to pass payment client and scheduler
   - Update any code that accesses Transaction.Memo to handle pointer

4. **Deploy and test**:
   - Deploy with `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_ENABLED=false` first
   - Test with a devnet wallet
   - Enable in production: `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_ENABLED=true`

### For New Deployments

Follow the environment variable setup above and set `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_ENABLED=true` from the start.

  "status_url": "/api/v1/registration-status/payment-registration:550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
}
```

### Check Registration Status

**Request:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/registration-status/payment-registration:550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000

}
```

**Response (Registration Complete):**
```json
{
  "status": "completed",

  "workflow_id": "payment-registration:550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "result": {
    "payment_signature": "5j7s8K...",
    "wallet_address": "YourWalletAddress123456",
    "network": "mainnet",
    "asset_type": "sol"
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Service Wallet Security**:
   - Store service wallet private key securely (never commit to version control)
   - Use a dedicated wallet only for receiving registration payments
   - Regularly sweep funds to a cold storage wallet

2. **Memo Prefix**:
   - Use a unique memo prefix for your service
   - Prevents accidental payment matching from other services

3. **Payment Timeout**:
   - Set a reasonable timeout (24-48 hours recommended)
   - Expired invoices cannot be used for registration

4. **Amount Verification**:
   - System verifies exact amount or greater
   - Prevents underpayment attacks

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Payment success rate**: Percentage of invoices that receive payment
2. **Payment time**: Average time from invoice generation to payment
3. **Registration completion rate**: Percentage of payments that successfully complete registration
4. **Workflow failures**: Monitor AwaitPayment and RegisterWallet activity errors

### Logs to Watch

```bash
# Payment gateway events
grep "payment.*gateway" logs/*.json | jq .

# Workflow executions
grep "PaymentGatedRegistrationWorkflow" logs/*.json | jq .

# Failed registrations after payment
grep "RegisterWallet.*error" logs/*.json | jq .
```

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Support for multiple payment options (SOL, USDC, other SPL tokens)
- [ ] Webhook notifications when payment is received
- [ ] Admin dashboard for monitoring payments and registrations
- [ ] Refund workflow for failed registrations after payment
- [ ] Dynamic pricing based on service load
- [ ] Payment QR code in SVG format for better scalability
